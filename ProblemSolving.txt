the user should be able to work with decimal points
after a decimal is entered for a number a second should not be enterd
the user should be able to enter first number, then operator and then second number
the calclator shall have an equal key for executing and displaying the operation
The calculator shall round decimals with large numbers
The calculator shall handle pressing equal before numbers entry
A clear button that clears all data
Divide by zero error
Backspace button

Refined (ChatGPT)
- The calculator application shall include basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The calculator shall support operations with decimal numbers.
- Users must be able to enter decimal points, but only one decimal point should be allowed per number.
- Users should enter the first number, followed by an operator, and then the second number to perform a calculation.
- The calculator shall include an "equals" (=) button to execute the operation and display the result.
- The calculator shall round results to a reasonable number of decimal places when dealing with large numbers.
- The calculator should handle the case where the "=" button is pressed before entering the second number by displaying an error message or defaulting to the last valid operation.
- The calculator shall have a "clear" button that resets all inputs and the display.
- The calculator shall display an error message for division by zero operations.
- The calculator shall include a "backspace" button to allow users to delete the last entered digit or character.

The calculator application shall support basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The application shall support decimal arithmetic, allowing users to input and operate on decimal numbers.
The application shall restrict the user to a single decimal point per number.
The user shall input the first operand, select an operator, and then input the second operand to perform a calculation.
The application shall provide an "=" button that executes the current operation and displays the result.
The application shall round results to a maximum of [specific number] decimal places for precision in displaying large numbers.
If the "=" button is pressed without valid second operand input, the application shall handle this scenario by [specific behavior, e.g., displaying an error message or ignoring the press].
The application shall include a "Clear" button that resets all inputs and clears the display.
The application shall display an error message when a division by zero operation is attempted.
The application shall include a "Backspace" button that allows the user to remove the last entered digit or character.
The calculator shall have appearance inspired from BRAUN 4954 calculator
plan
consume last operation and display result when next operator is entered (e.g 2+2-3, user should see 4 when - sign is pressed)
makes a simple black and white calculator
make the symbols and numbers bold
